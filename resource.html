    <h2>Theo Hutton</h2>
    <p>
      Theo is aged 5 years old and lives in West Kirby on the Wirral. Theo was
      starved of oxygen needing over seven minutes resuscitation and suffered a
      severe brain injury resulting in quadriplegic cerebral palsy. We want to
      help Theo reach his full potential and have an amazing quality of life by
      raising funds for life changing stem cell treatment and specialised
      equipment outside of the NHS, including intensive hyperbaric oxygen
      treatment. Theo is the biggest fighter we know with every little thing he
      does being a challenge. He has the biggest smile and is the happiest
      little boy who deserves a chance of the life he can enjoy just like
      everybody else. There are numerous therapies and pioneering treatments
      available, but they are not accessible on the NHS and the expense is very
      high. Not only will Theo need this treatment, he will also need specialist
      equipment. This is why we as Theo's parents and family want to launch
      'Theo's Fight' Campaign.      
    </p>
